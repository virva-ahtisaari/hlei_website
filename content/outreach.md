(Below is fake information... or real?)  
As an astrophysicist dedicated to safeguarding our planet from cosmic threats, I joined the Planetary Defense Council in 2042, motivated by a desire to contribute to humanity's preparedness against potential extraterrestrial challenges. My journey in outreach began shortly thereafter, where I had the privilege of participating in a series of public engagement initiatives. Between 2044 and 2048, I traveled to several renowned cities across the globe, including New York, Tokyo, London, and Berlin, to promote the Wallfacer Project.

During these outreach efforts, I aimed to raise awareness about the complex dynamics of interstellar relations and the critical importance of strategic thinking in the face of potential existential threats. By engaging with diverse audiences, from students to policymakers, I sought to ignite curiosity about astrophysics and to foster a sense of global responsibility towards planetary defense.

In 2049, I took on the esteemed role of judge for the Wallfacer Project, a unique initiative designed to harness the brightest minds to devise ingenious strategies for humanity's survival. This experience allowed me to witness firsthand the innovative ideas and collaborative spirit that emerged from the project.

My passion for astrophysics, combined with my commitment to public outreach, drives my ongoing efforts to bridge the gap between science and society. I believe that informed citizens are crucial for effective decision-making in planetary defense, and I remain dedicated to empowering individuals with knowledge about the universe and our place within it. Through continued outreach, I aspire to inspire future generations to engage with the wonders of astrophysics and to prepare for the challenges that lie ahead.

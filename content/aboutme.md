### Profile

<img src="hh3.png" width="200" align="left" hspace="100">

(Below is fake information... or real?)  Han Lei is an astrophysicist with a focus on planetary defense and interstellar challenges. My research primarily centers on the Wandering Earth Project, where I explore the feasibility of relocating humanity in the face of cosmic threats, as well as developing defense strategies against the Trisolaran fleet. With a background in theoretical astrophysics, I aim to combine innovative modeling with practical applications to address these critical issues. Additionally, I have been actively involved in outreach initiatives, promoting awareness of planetary defense and inspiring future generations to engage with the wonders and challenges of our universe.

  

### Beyond science
I used to play football for Jiuxianghe College as a goalkeeper. In the Jiangning University Women Football Cup 2031, I saved two penalties in the semi-final penalty shoot-out and helped the team advance to the final. Currently I am a goalkeeper coach of my community football team.

 I serve for the Organization for the Preservation of Human Order, Finis Chaldea, in my spare time. I also worked for Rhodes Island Pharmaceutical Incorporation during 2034-2036.

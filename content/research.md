My research interests lie at the intersection of theoretical astrophysics and pragmatic planetary defense, focusing on two critical areas: the Wandering Earth Project[^1] and strategies for defending against the Trisolaran fleet[^2].

The Wandering Earth Project captivates me due to its ambitious vision of relocating humanity to ensure survival in the face of astronomical threats. This project raises fundamental questions about the feasibility of large-scale planetary engineering, the sociopolitical ramifications of such an endeavor, and the technological innovations required to make it a reality. My research explores the potential methods for propulsion and navigation on a cosmic scale, as well as the ecological and ethical considerations of moving entire populations. I aim to contribute to the theoretical frameworks that underpin these massive undertakings, blending astrophysical modeling with environmental science to assess the long-term implications of such a migration.

Equally pressing is the challenge of developing effective defense strategies against the Trisolaran fleet. As we grapple with the implications of first contact with an advanced extraterrestrial civilization, understanding the tactical options available to humanity becomes paramount. My work in this area focuses on simulating the dynamics of interstellar combat and the potential technologies that could be employed to counteract the capabilities of the Trisolaran fleet. By analyzing the physics of gravitational interactions, energy weaponry, and strategic positioning, I strive to formulate robust defense mechanisms that not only protect Earth but also foster cooperation among nations in a time of potential crisis.

Through interdisciplinary collaboration and innovative research, I seek to advance our understanding of these critical issues, ensuring that humanity is well-prepared for whatever challenges lie ahead in the cosmos.
